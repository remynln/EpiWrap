# EpiWrap

This is a wrapper for the epitech intranet 'api'

You can see here some examples:

````python
import epiwrap

client = epiwrap.EpiWrap("your token here")

user = client.getProfile()

print("Name: " + user.fullname + "\nCredits: " + str(user.credits))
````


## How to get your token ?

You must be connected to the [intranet](https://intra.epitech.eu/)

Now with the network tool (firefox "ctrl + shift + e", chrome "ctrl + shift + i" and then go in the network tab)
Click on the `/` request

Now go on the `cookies tab` and copy your user token (it should look like this)

Now you have your token, (don't forget that the cookie resets, so you have to change it when it's reset. Unfortunately I can't do anything to correct this)
